!!MUSICAL NOTES!!

Aim: To create a ceratin matrix as per the input given by the user and to play a note from the 8 musical notes which are Do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti, do.

- Initially the hover should play a random note.
- The next hover should play the next note in the sequence.
- If the initial note played is the last note in the sequence then a random note from the 8 notes will be played.
